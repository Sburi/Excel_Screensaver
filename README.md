# VBA_Screensaver
A fun, simple screensaver that starts on workbook open and ends on workbook close.

To Use:
Simply open the file, enable macros.

To Close:
If cell colors are being changed, you can either wait for them to finish and then close Excel, or press ESC to exit early.

To Improve:
If you'd like to add your own themes or fill patterns feel free to add them in to the slct_Theme and slct_Fill Case sections, then just increase the randbetween selection at the top of the code to include all possible options.

Thanks!
